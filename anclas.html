	<p>Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was... I seem to have found it.</p>

	<p>There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while. Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck! </p>

	<p>The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.</p>

	<p>Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.
